# Microsoft.Azure.Kusto.Data library

Kusto Client SDK (Kusto.Data) exposes a programmatic API similar to ADO.NET, so using it should feel
natural for people experienced in .NET. Briefly speaking, one creates either a query client (`ICslQueryProvider`) or a control command
provider (`ICslAdminProvider`) from a connection string object pointing at the Kusto engine service, database, authentication
method, etc. This allows one to then issue data queries or control commands by specifying the appropriate Kusto query language
string, and get back one or more data tables via the returned `IDataReader` object.

More specifically, to create an ADO.NET-like client allowing queries against
Kusto, one uses static methods on the `Kusto.Data.Net.Client.KustoClientFactory`
class. These take the connection string and create a thread-safe, disposable,
client object. (It is strongly recommended that client code refrains from
creating "too many" instances of this object, and instead create an
object per connection string and hold on to it for as long as it is needed.)
This allows the client object to efficiently cache resources. 

In general, all methods on the clients are thread-safe with two exceptions: `Dispose`, 
and setter properties. For consistent results, one should not invoke either methods
concurrently.

## Usage examples

**Example: Counting Rows**

The following code demonstrates counting the rows of a table called MyTable in the database MyDatabase running locally:

```csharp
var client = Kusto.Data.Net.Client.KustoClientFactory.CreateCslQueryProvider("https://help.kusto.windows.net/Samples;Fed=true");
var reader = client.ExecuteQuery("MyTable | count");
// Read the first row from reader -- it's 0'th column is the count of records in MyTable
// Don't forget to dispose of reader when done.
```

**Example: Getting diagnostics info from the Kusto cluster**

```csharp
var kcsb = new KustoConnectionStringBuilder(cluster URI here);
using (var client = KustoClientFactory.CreateCslAdminProvider(kcsb))
{
    var diagnosticsCommand = CslCommandGenerator.GenerateShowDiagnosticsCommand();
    var objectReader = new ObjectReader<DiagnosticsShowCommandResult>(client.ExecuteControlCommand(diagnosticsCommand));
    DiagnosticsShowCommandResult diagResult = objectReader.ToList().FirstOrDefault();
    // Do something with the diagResult
}
```

## The KustoClientFactory client factory

The static class `Kusto.Data.Net.Client.KustoClientFactory` provides the main entry point for authors
of client code that utilizes Kusto. It provides the following important static methods:

|Method                                      |Returns                                |Used for                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|`CreateCslQueryProvider`                    |`ICslQueryProvider`                    |Sending queries to a Kusto engine cluster.                    |
|`CreateCslAdminProvider`                    |`ICslAdminProvider`                    |Sending control commands to a Kusto cluster (of any kind).    |
|`CreateRedirectProvider`                    |`IRedirectProvider`                    |Creating a redirect HTTP response message for a Kusto request.|
